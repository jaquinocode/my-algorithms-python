def sale_hotdogs(customers):
    #psuedo
    just calculate total price (all_customers*a_price)
    w/ a little caveat, based on how many customers I get, the price for everybody 
    will be different

def sale_hotdogs(customers):
    #price changes depending on customers val
    price = 100 if customers<5 else 95 if 5<=customers<10 else 90

    return customers*price

def blah():
    for stu_answer, correct_answer in zip(stu_answer, correct_answer):
        if stu_answer != correct_answer:
            return False
    return True

zip uses many args instead of iterators as arguments
    returns generator!!!! :DDDD
min/max can do both
